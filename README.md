## Hi there 👋

🌱 I’m currently a Global Change Geography MSc student (2nd semester) at Humboldt Universität zu Berlin.

⭐ I am a physical geographer interested in using spaceborne remote sensing to study natural hazard events, specifically wildfire and drought. I am also interested in exploring the intersection between natural hazards
 and social vulnerability, which specifically relate to resilience.
